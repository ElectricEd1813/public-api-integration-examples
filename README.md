## [Agendrix](https://www.agendrix.com/)'s public API integration examples

This project contains examples of how to integrate with Agendrix's public [API](https://api.agendrix.com), from the OAuth authentication to making calls to the API itself. 

There is currently two examples, one written in [JS](./js) - TS more precisely -, and the other in [Ruby](./ruby).

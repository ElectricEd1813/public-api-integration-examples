## [Agendrix](https://www.agendrix.com/)'s public API integration examples

This project contains examples of how to integrate with Agendrix's public [API](https://api.agendrix.com), from the OAuth authentication to making calls to the API itself. 

There is currently three examples, one written in [JS](./js) - TS more precisely -, another in [Ruby](./ruby) and the last one is for an [application without a browser available](https://github.com/agendrix/public-api-integration-examples/tree/main/non-browser-apps).
